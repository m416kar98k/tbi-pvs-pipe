# tbi-pvs-pipe
A pipeline for repeated data preprocessing procedures for different cohorts

## Summary

The contents include how to preprocess data from compressed dicom scans and csv summaries. It is a shared script directory and would **NOT** contain any algorithms or dataset which had not been public released. I would also upload an automated graphical version for LONI Pipeline users to preprocess their data in the near future. To run the scripts, users need to install pandas with their python. 

## Installation Requirement
1. Python with scientific environment (pandas and pytorch required)
2. FreeSurfer v5.3.0 (Please visit http://ftp.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/pub/dist/freesurfer/5.3.0/)
3. FSL v5.0.11 (Please visit https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/patches/eddy-patch-fsl-5.0.11/)
